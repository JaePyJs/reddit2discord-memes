# GitHub Instructions for Codebase Reorganization

This document provides instructions for pushing the reorganized codebase to GitHub.

## Recommended Branch Strategy

For a major reorganization like this, it's best to use a feature branch approach:

1. Create a new branch for the reorganization
2. Make all changes in this branch
3. Create a pull request for review
4. Merge the changes after testing and approval

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create a new branch

```bash
# Make sure you're on the main branch first
git checkout main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/codebase-reorganization
```

### 2. Run the reorganization script

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x reorganize.sh

# Run the script
./reorganize.sh
```

### 3. Test the reorganized codebase

```bash
# Start the bot to ensure everything works
python -m bot.main
```

### 4. Commit the changes

```bash
# Add all changes to staging
git add .

# Commit with the prepared message
git commit -F commit_message.txt
```

### 5. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push the branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/codebase-reorganization
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Pull requests" tab
3. Click "New pull request"
4. Select:
   - Base: main
   - Compare: feature/codebase-reorganization
5. Click "Create pull request"
6. Add a title and description (you can use the content from commit_message.txt)
7. Assign reviewers if applicable
8. Click "Create pull request"

### 7. Review and Merge

1. Wait for any CI/CD processes to complete
2. Address any feedback from reviewers
3. Once approved, merge the pull request:
   - Click "Merge pull request"
   - Click "Confirm merge"
4. Delete the branch after merging (optional)

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after merging:

1. Identify the specific issues
2. If the issues are minor, fix them in new commits
3. If the issues are major, consider:
   - Creating a revert commit: `git revert <merge-commit-hash>`
   - Or fixing in a new branch and creating a new PR

## Additional Notes

- This reorganization is a breaking change, so ensure all team members are aware
- Update any documentation or wikis to reflect the new structure
- Consider updating any CI/CD pipelines if necessary
- If you have automated tests, run them before and after the reorganization
